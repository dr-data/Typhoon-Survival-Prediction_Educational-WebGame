# Typhoon Survival Prediction - Educational Web Game

## Related: Once in N Years (return period)

This repository now also includes **Once in N Years**, a Cloudflare-hosted educational game that teaches the statistical meaning of “once in N years” (return period) for non-science university students, based on the [Hong Kong Observatory article](https://www.hko.gov.hk/en/education/climate/climate-change/00672-Return-Period-Once-in-N-Years.html).

- Play locally: `cd once-in-n-years && npm install && npm test && npm run dev`
- Product plan: [`once-in-n-years/docs/PRODUCT.md`](./once-in-n-years/docs/PRODUCT.md)

The original typhoon-survival prototype below is unchanged.

## 📋 Overview

This project is a data-driven disaster education web game developed for the Taiwanese government. It uses machine learning to predict typhoon survival outcomes based on household prevention behaviors, helping citizens understand which safety measures are most effective during natural disasters.

The prototype won the **"Most Popular Award"** at the MVP demo day and secured a government contract to build the full production version now deployed by Taiwan's National Science and Technology Center for Disaster Reduction.

## 🧠 Machine Learning Model

![Model Architecture](./presentation/project1-3.png)
*Deep Neural Network Structure*

The prediction model was built using:
- **Dataset**: Post-typhoon household survey data from Social Impacts and Recovery Survey of Typhoon Morakot (2010-2019)
- **Source**: [NCDR Disaster Statistics Platform](https://drrstat.ncdr.nat.gov.tw/)
- **Architecture**: Self-built deep neural network using PyTorch
- **Performance**: ~80% classification accuracy
- **Population Groups**: 256 distinct demographic classifications

### Model Interpretability

![Explainable AI](./presentation/project1-4.png)
*Integrated Gradients with SmoothGrad for model explainability*

The model uses Explainable AI techniques to identify which prevention behaviors have the strongest impact on survival outcomes, with statistical significance at 99% confidence level for both linear and non-linear relationships.
